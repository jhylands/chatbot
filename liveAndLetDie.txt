 ..was so ably pointed out<br> by the Secretary-General<br> in his opening remarks.<br> But - and I must emphasise this point -<br> no formula can, or will,<br> ever cover each case.<br> For instance...<br> ..when three or more applicants<br> have been recognised,<br> which is in direct contradiction to...<br> Whose funeral is it?<br> Yours.<br> One more time again.<br> Not married, by any chance, are you?<br> Good morning, 007.<br> Good... good morning.<br> Insomnia, sir?<br> Instructions.<br> You haven't much time.<br> I'll explain as you pack.<br> Pack, sir?<br> Three agents have been killed<br> in the last 24 hours.<br> Dawes in New York, Hamilton in<br> New Orleans and Baines in the Caribbean.<br> Baines. I rather liked Baines.<br> We shared the same boot maker.<br> Coffee,<br> sir?<br> I take it these killings are connected?<br> That's precisely<br> what you're going to find out.<br> Baines was working on a small<br> Caribbean island called San Monique.<br> Dawes was in New York,<br> keeping an eye on its prime minister,<br> one Dr Kananga.<br> Hamilton was on loan to the Americans<br> in New Orleans.<br> Is that all it does?<br> By the way, congratulations.<br> The ltalians were most impressed<br> by the way you handled the Rome affair.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Sugar?<br> Thanks.<br> The authorities<br> were more than helpful.<br> There's one small complaint.<br> They seem to be missing<br> one of their agents.<br> A Miss... Caruso.<br> You wouldn't happen to know<br> where she is?<br> Miss Moneypenny.<br> - Morning, Moneypenny.<br> - Good morning, sir.<br> - It's only the hour that's indecent.<br> - Really?<br> I've got your ticket to New York.<br> Q has repaired your wristwatch.<br> - And some background on San Monique.<br> - Thank you, Moneypenny.<br> I'm sure the overburdened British<br> taxpayer will be fascinated to know<br> will how the Special Ordnance Section<br> disburses its funds.<br> In future, Commander, may I suggest<br> a perfectly adequate watchmaker<br> just down the street.<br> Good God!<br> Pulling out this button turns the watch<br> into a hyper-intensified magnetic field,<br> powerful enough to deflect<br> the path of a bullet<br> - at long range - or so Q claims.<br> - I feel tempted to test that theory now.<br> If you don't mind, Commander, my spoon.<br> Sorry, sir.<br> Thank you.<br> Dr Kananga is at present in New York.<br> The CIA have been informed.<br> They are helping with surveillance.<br> Your flight arrives at 1 1 .30am.<br> Now, where did I leave my coat?<br> Allow me.<br> Thank you.<br> Come along, Miss Moneypenny.<br> - Morning, Bond.<br> - Sir.<br> Miss Moneypenny.<br> Thank you.<br> Goodbye, James.<br> Or should I say... ciao, bello?<br> Such a delicate touch.<br> Sheer magnetism, darling.<br> A man comes.<br> He travels quickly.<br> He has purpose.<br> He comes over water.<br> He travels with others.<br> He will oppose.<br> He brings violence and destruction.<br> Hello.<br> - Mr Leiter for you, sir.<br> - Thank you.<br> Hello, Felix. How are you?<br> Traffic permitting,<br> I should be with you in halfan hour.<br> Then you can buy me<br> the best lunch in New York.<br> Hi, James. Your friend Kananga<br> has just left the UN.<br> He's probably headed back<br> to his embassy.<br> No, don't worry. The place is eyeballed,<br> wired for sound - the works.<br> Right. I'll see you in a half-hour.<br> Easy, Charlie.<br> Let's get there in one piece.<br> Charlie?<br> Right, stand by.<br> Here comes Kananga's limousine.<br> Out he gets<br> with the usual goon squad<br> and the girl.<br> Time: 1 1 .46.<br> What is that?!<br> Felix? You know I hate to trouble you,<br> but I've run into a little bother.<br> You what?!<br> Get me a make on a white pimpmobile.<br> 3-4-7. Nelson David George.<br> It would seem, Dr Kananga,<br> that the conference has not<br> Iived up to your expectations.<br> We can only hope that<br> this is a temporary setback.<br> However, I do have<br> some observations to make.<br> Take a letter, please.<br> To Secretary-General,<br> Pan-lsland Unity Conference.<br> Sir...<br> I wish to point out...<br> that...<br> too many<br> of our island neighbours<br> have once again let themselves be...<br> bullied by United States industry.<br> The story is an old one,<br> the record a clear one.<br> Since my historic statement ofprinciples<br> was delivered and acted upon<br> some six months ago,<br> our economic outlook<br> has improved dramatically.<br> By exercising our policy of friendship<br> to all with favouritism towards none,<br> new respect for the entire area<br> has been injected.<br> And even though some ofmy...<br> James? That car is registered<br> to a shop at 33 East 65th Street.<br> That's only a block away from here.<br> Right. Take your time, buddy.<br> Kananga's knitting a flag in there.<br> It might be the easiest thing to do.<br> Something... in heads?<br> Just browsing, thank you.<br> Five dollars.<br> Do you think you could<br> giftwrap it for me, please?<br> Lengthwise, if you don't mind.<br> Thank you.<br> ..remains my first concern.<br> Thus San Monique's obligations to<br> her island neighbours would seem clear.<br> Those who fawn and crawl<br> in the face ofintimidation<br> must perforce look up<br> to those who stand, proudly,<br> wrapped in ajustifiable self-confidence.<br> The time has come,<br> painful as it may be,<br> to gaze out among our sister nations<br> in the area and see ifany stands...<br> He's tailing.<br> I got him in my sights.<br> - You know where you're goin', man?<br> - Uptown, I believe.<br> Uptown? We headin' into Harlem, man.<br> Just keep on the tail of that jukebox<br> and there's an extra $20 for you.<br> Man, for 20 bucks,<br> I'd take you to a Ku Klux Klan cookout.<br> 1 25th. You got a honky on your tail.<br> He's heading east.<br> Can't miss him.<br> It's like following a cue ball.<br> That's the car.<br> They must have gone inside.<br> Pull up where you can.<br> Sure hope you make friends easy.<br> Right on, brother.<br> He's headin' on in!<br> Good afternoon.<br> - Bourbon and water, please.<br> - The first booth will do.<br> Tell him neat, would you?<br> - No ice.<br> - That's extra, man.<br> I'd like something on the side as well.<br> Information.<br> Three men and a girl came in...<br> Relax, baby.<br> Mr Big's gonna take care of you<br> in a minute.<br> Black queen on the red king, Miss...?<br> Solitaire.<br> My name's Bond.<br> James Bond.<br> I know who you are,<br> what you are, and why you've come.<br> You've made a mistake.<br> You will not succeed.<br> Rather a sweeping statement,<br> considering we've never met.<br> The cards have followed you for me.<br> You get ripped off in Detroit,<br> you yell out to me! D'you hear?<br> Is he armed?<br> You can't be too careful in New York City.<br> Funny how the least little thing<br> amuses him.<br> Fascinating.<br> That's you, quite obviously.<br> An amazing resemblance.<br> Am I in there as well?<br> Pick a card.<br> Turn it over.<br> You have found yourself.<br> I'm telling you,<br> go out to LA and clean it up<br> or I'm coming out there<br> and clean you up. And I mean that!<br> Is this the stupid mother<br> that tailed you uptown?<br> There seems to be some mistake.<br> My name...<br> Names is for tombstones, baby.<br> Y'all take this honky out<br> and waste him - now!<br> - "Waste him"? ls that a good thing?<br> - The reading is over.<br> Nothing about my future?<br> Us?<br> Now, promise you'll stay right there.<br> I shan't be long.<br> Thank you.<br> Keep your hands up, honky.<br> What's he think this is?<br> Blow his friggin' head off.<br> Drop it!<br> Now.<br> Harold Strutter, CIA. Where were you<br> when I didn't need you?<br> It got obvious<br> you weren't coming out front.<br> Not even with that clever disguise<br> you were wearing.<br> A white face in Harlem.<br> Good thinking, Bond.<br> Let's get outta here.<br> I'm surprised they didn't spot you.<br> There's a remarkable girl back there<br> with a deck of cards.<br> I saw those cards on the way up.<br> Spades, James. Every one.<br> You were nailed the minute you left 74.<br> Only one man can pull together<br> that much black muscle in this town.<br> Calls himself Mr Big.<br> You name the business.<br> They say he has a black concession.<br> What would a foreign prime minister<br> like Kananga<br> want with an American gangster?<br> Question is, what would Mr Big<br> want with a two-bit island diplomat?<br> Mr Big? Where the hell<br> does he fit into this mess?<br> A genuine Felix lighter. Illuminating.<br> Now listen, James,<br> Kananga's got a private plane and he's<br> leaving for San Monique within the hour.<br> - Get me on the next available flight.<br> - I already did.<br> I knew you wouldn't pass up a chance<br> to get away from where the real action is.<br> The legendary Baron Samedi, folks.<br> That's Saturday,<br> for those who speak French.<br> Voodoo god of cemeteries<br> and chief of the legion of the dead.<br> The man who cannot die.<br> But, for our purposes,<br> just a performer in a musical<br> extravaganza we've cooked up<br> for you wonderful people.<br> Good evening. The name's Bond.<br> I have a reservation.<br> Mr Bond. Of course.<br> Mrs Bond's been expecting you.<br> - Mrs Bond?<br> - She arrived earlier this afternoon.<br> Said she preferred<br> something a little more... private.<br> Bungalow 1 2.<br> An incurable romantic - Mrs Bond.<br> Room service, please.<br> Room service?<br> This is Mr Bond. Bungalow 1 2.<br> I'd like a bottle of Bollinger, please.<br> Slightly chilled.<br> Two glasses. Thank you.<br> Anybody home?<br> Your champagne, sir.<br> - What was that?<br> - Your champagne.<br> Put it on the table, thanks.<br> - Shall I open it?<br> - What?<br> Shall I open it?<br> Oh, no. I can manage. Thank you.<br> - Here you are.<br> - Thank you.<br> Mrs Bond, I presume?<br> I'm Rosie Carver.<br> I guess I have a little explaining to do.<br> Yes. Either you or<br> dear Uncle Felix.<br> Custom 38, Smith &amp; Wesson.<br> Corrugated three-inch stock,<br> no serial number, standard CIA issue.<br> The question is: why point it at me?<br> The man who delivered your champagne<br> is not a hotel waiter.<br> I was just trying to be careful.<br> As for Felix Leiter, you're right.<br> I've worked for CIA down here<br> for some time now.<br> He cabled me you were coming<br> and asked if I would help out if I could.<br> Perhaps you'd better start<br> by getting your head together.<br> - There's a mirror in the bathroom.<br> - Yes.<br> You're only my second mission,<br> you know.<br> My first was Baines.<br> The agent who was killed.<br> It's a relief to know I'm next in line<br> for the same kind of aid.<br> - There's a...<br> - A snake! I should have told you.<br> You should never go in there<br> without a mongoose.<br> I should have never<br> gotten into any of this!<br> I'm going to be completely useless to you.<br> I'm sure we'll be able<br> to lick you into shape.<br> It's... getting late, Mrs Bond.<br> Tomorrow will be a very busy day.<br> You see, Kananga is<br> protecting something down here.<br> Something which Baines<br> obviously discovered.<br> You're going to show me the spot<br> where Baines' body was found.<br> That, I'm afraid,<br> only leaves us tonight to...<br> catch up on old times.<br> Felix told me there'd be<br> moments like this.<br> What did good old Felix suggest?<br> If all else failed,<br> cyanide pills.<br> I settled for two bedrooms.<br> Good night, Mr Bond.<br> Mrs Bond.<br> It's just a hat, darling,<br> belonging to a small-headed man<br> who lost a fight with a chicken.<br> It's a warning. Get it outta here!<br> Oh, please!<br> Please don't leave me alone tonight.<br> James, please promise me!<br> All right, darling,<br> if you insist... I promise.<br> Thank you.<br> Rosie!<br> Breakfast's up!<br> Rosie!<br> - Are you ready yet?<br> - What?<br> I have to see about organising a car.<br> I'll see you in the lobby.<br> Over here, sir!<br> Guarantee big fish. Catch big fish, sir!<br> Hey, baby! Over here!<br> Bring your man over here!<br> Just $20! Have a date!<br> You got warm lady?<br> We got cold beer over here, man.<br> You wanna catch a big fish, sir?<br> It's only 2 over here.<br> Good morning.<br> Come on, Rosie.<br> This one seems eager enough.<br> Excuse me!<br> Where can I change?<br> Me... clothes off... where?<br> Stop right there.<br> Turn around slowly.<br> Keep your hands up!<br> As I was saying, Quarrel, a lousy agent.<br> But the compensations<br> speak for themselves.<br> Rosie Carver, meet the man<br> who shares my hairbrush.<br> Quarrel Junior.<br> I'm really sorry. I could have shot you.<br> You might have even killed me<br> if you'd taken off the safety catch.<br> Never mind, darling.<br> You just let us know when we get<br> to the spot where Baines was killed.<br> It's up in the hills,<br> just after we clear the next cove.<br> Hey, Quarrel!<br> Who the hell lives up there?<br> That's the house of the Kananga woman.<br> She's supposed to have<br> the power of the obeah.<br> No one on the island<br> dare go up there except him.<br> He comes again.<br> There will be violence.<br> He approaches even now.<br> By land or water?<br> Water.<br> He has arrived.<br> Good.<br> Rosie's been more efficient<br> than I anticipated.<br> I know where<br> we could rustle up a car.<br> Beautiful, brave, and now resourceful.<br> Rosie, you seem to be staging<br> a remarkable comeback.<br> Tell me about the future.<br> Is it death?<br> I said, is it death?<br> It is death.<br> They're coming.<br> Rosie knows what to do.<br> Now, I want no bodies this time. No trace.<br> It's down there.<br> But... I thought you said<br> Baines was killed up in the hills, darling.<br> Up in the hills, down there.<br> Why don't we have a bite of lunch<br> and discuss it?<br> There's an excellent pt in the hamper.<br> I'm in no hurry.<br> Are you?<br> No.<br> James!<br> You don't know<br> what finding you has meant to me.<br> I can imagine.<br> And you've no idea<br> what finding this has meant to me.<br> You do know what the Queen of Cups<br> means in an upside-down position?<br> A deceitful, perverse woman.<br> A liar, a cheat.<br> And I'd like some answers now.<br> Please...<br> You don't understand, sir.<br> They'll kill me if I do.<br> And I'll kill you if you don't.<br> But you couldn't. You wouldn't.<br> Not after what we've just done.<br> I certainly wouldn't<br> have killed you before.<br> It used to be a convincing act, Rosie.<br> It's wearing a little thin now.<br> It's not an act. It's...<br> Make your choice.<br> Rosie!<br> You will explain what went wrong.<br> I see the intervention of a woman.<br> The girl was about to confess.<br> We had to kill her.<br> The trap was set.<br> Tee Hee was waiting.<br> And you saw death.<br> It must have been the girl's death.<br> If you do not ask specific questions,<br> I cannot be responsible for your<br> misinterpretation of the answers.<br> These growing signs of impertinence<br> begin to disturb me, Solitaire.<br> As they did with your mother before you.<br> She had the power and lost it.<br> Became useless to me.<br> You will not make the same mistake,<br> Solitaire.<br> Where is Bond now?<br> Where is Bond now?!<br> I cannot see<br> when you are this way with me.<br> Things become unclear.<br> Let us hope these momentary lapses<br> do not become a habit.<br> Your power exists to serve me.<br> And it is mine to control.<br> If and when the time comes I decide you<br> are to lose it, I myself will take it away.<br> Solitaire, go to sleep. You have made me<br> angry with you, and I have no wish to be.<br> Tee Hee...<br> Put down those cards!<br> It is a blasphemy!<br> They tell nothing<br> to those who cannot see.<br> But they do. That's a... a bit of luck.<br> Good luck, for both of us.<br> The cards say we will be lovers.<br> You are mistaken.<br> It's impossible. Forbidden for me.<br> Now you must go.<br> But you do believe,...<br> I mean really believe in the cards?<br> They have never lied to me.<br> Then they won't now.<br> Pick one.<br> You knew the answer before it was given.<br> Strangely enough, somehow,...<br> so did l.<br> So it's finally happened.<br> Just as it did to my mother...<br> and her mother before her.<br> Of course it did.<br> You're visual proof of that, aren't you?<br> Come on, cheer up, darling.<br> There has to be a first time for everyone.<br> Now tell me,<br> where's Kananga?<br> I cannot see.<br> - Oh, yes, the cards. I'll get them.<br> - No!<br> There's no need to be frightened.<br> You'll soon be rid of him, I promise.<br> I promise.<br> I just need a<br> Iittle bit of information, that's all.<br> The power...<br> I've lost it.<br> The High Priestess is wife<br> to the Prince no longer of this world.<br> The spiritual bridge to the secret church.<br> It was my fate.<br> By compelling me to earthly love,<br> the cards themselves<br> have taken away my powers.<br> Darling, I've...<br> a small confession to make.<br> Now, try not to be too upset.<br> The deck was slightly stacked<br> in my favour.<br> It makes no difference.<br> The physical violation cannot be undone.<br> When he finds out I've lost my power,...<br> he'll kill me.<br> Oh, now, come on.<br> He'll have to find you first.<br> Lovers' lesson number one:<br> we have no secrets.<br> For example, I have a boat waiting.<br> You can be on it.<br> All I have to know before we leave is...<br> what goes on back there in voodoo land.<br> Darling, three men and a girl<br> have been killed in the last four days.<br> Not counting the times<br> they've tried to stop me<br> from discovering<br> what Kananga's protecting.<br> Now, do you want to be<br> on that boat or not?<br> I simply read the cards for him.<br> I have never been there,<br> and he's never taken me there.<br> I've never dared to go.<br> But I've looked in the cards.<br> I've seen great riches there.<br> They'll kill you.<br> Us, darling.<br> They will kill us.<br> Lovers' lesson number two: togetherness.<br> Till death do us part, or thereabouts.<br> Is there time before we leave<br> for lesson number three?<br> Absolutely.<br> There's no sense in going off half-cocked.<br> - This way.<br> - How can you be so sure?<br> These scarecrows are to scare<br> people away. You're not scared, are you?<br> Lesson number four:<br> follow the scarecrows.<br> - Good morning, boss.<br> - Morning.<br> It's sure gonna be a beautiful day.<br> Yes, sir, a beautiful day!<br> They're heading for the hill.<br> They're here.<br> If he finds it, kill him.<br> Quick!<br> We've lost him. He has the girl.<br> They're somewhere under the nets.<br> At any cost - any - Bond must die.<br> Unit 2-5. We have picked them up.<br> Base to 2-5. Arrest Bond.<br> But I repeat, the girl is not to be touched.<br> Message received and understood.<br> Over and out.<br> Base to all units.<br> I repeat, the girl is not to be touched.<br> Get out of the way!<br> Sweet mother of pearl!<br> All change! End of the line!<br> Get down below, quickly!<br> Here, I'll do that. You get her started.<br> It appears... a bus.<br> James!<br> He'll be looking for me now.<br> I know he'll never stop.<br> Come on, darling.<br> It's all over.<br> Voodoo land was just poppy fields.<br> A simple matter of heroin smuggling.<br> I'll have a word with a man named Felix,<br> turn the case over to him,<br> and you and I will be off.<br> By the way, where would you like to go?<br> Anywhere where we can find<br> one of these.<br> How quickly can we make it<br> to New Orleans?<br> Santa Mina, four hours away...<br> You could catch a flight<br> and be there in the morning.<br> Get in touch with Felix. Tell him to meet<br> me there tomorrow. Royal Orleans Hotel.<br> Tampa is closer.<br> Hamilton was killed in New Orleans,<br> so there has to be a connection.<br> And this is a valuable piece<br> of merchandise we're carrying.<br> Which, with any luck, they'll want back.<br> Royal Orleans Hotel, please.<br> Are you sure this is the way<br> to New Orleans?<br> I don't know, but this sure<br> beats the hell out of Harlem, don't it?<br> Well, hello, Jim!<br> What's happenin', baby?<br> Just ease back now, Jim. Relax!<br> Mr Big wants to see you.<br> You made a mistake<br> back on that island, Bond.<br> You took something that didn't belong<br> to you, from a friend of Mr Big's.<br> That type of mistake<br> is tough to bounce back from.<br> - But I've only just arrived.<br> - Today is your lucky day, Jim!<br> You're going skydiving!<br> There's a helluva view of the lake<br> from 10,000 feet.<br> My only regret is I won't be there to see it.<br> Let's go!<br> - Good morning. You're...<br> - Mrs Bell.<br> You're not my instructor.<br> Where's Mr Bleeker?<br> Indisposed. I'll be giving the lesson.<br> What's on for today?<br> Let's just wing it, shall we, Mrs Bell?<br> You're over-revving.<br> - Leroy, slow down, for Pete's sake!<br> - Do what the man say!<br> I can't... I can't find the brake!<br> Close those doors!<br> Holy shit!<br> OK, Don. Don't worry,<br> I'll take care of it. Right.<br> Talk to you later.<br> I've got to go and give a lesson.<br> Same time tomorrow, Mrs Bell?<br> Yes, Mr Bleeker.<br> Yes, sir. I know you just can't<br> glue the wings back on.<br> Now, Mr Bleeker, I'm sure<br> there's no reason for name-calling.<br> That's fine. Don't forget the double vents.<br> I appreciate she's one of your best pupils.<br> That's a little frantic.<br> I'll keep the other three.<br> Any such suggestion<br> should be put in writing to Washington.<br> - How is Mrs Bell?<br> - Intensive care, but she'll pull through.<br> Yes, sir.<br> No one's questioning your patriotism.<br> I'm sure you're a veteran, sir.<br> Felix, find out if there's<br> a Fillet Of Soul restaurant in town.<br> We're way ahead of you. It's on<br> Docker Street. Strutter's watching it now.<br> Hell of a send-off.<br> This way.<br> - Where's Strutter?<br> - He's gotta be inside somewhere.<br> Two, gentlemen?<br> I got a nice booth over here,<br> just against the wall.<br> Do you think you could find something<br> a little closer to the stage?<br> - What's wrong with a booth?<br> - I once had a nasty turn in a booth.<br> - Bourbon. No ice, please.<br> - Two Sazeracs.<br> Where's your sense of adventure?<br> This is New Orleans. Relax!<br> - One of you Felix Leiter?<br> - Yeah, right here.<br> - Call for you. A guy called Strutter.<br> - Thanks.<br> For a minute, I thought Harry<br> was laying down on a job.<br> What happened to my...<br> - What happened to my friend?<br> - What happened? Listen.<br> Thanks for droppin' in, baby.<br> Yeah, you're one tough pig to nail down.<br> You've been picking at me<br> like some kind of maggot.<br> First, you go up to Harlem<br> and kill one of the brothers.<br> And that disturbed me.<br> And then you go and steal<br> this valuable young lady<br> from my good friend, Dr Kananga.<br> Now, old Kananga, he believes<br> in all that card crap.<br> I mean, he's mad.<br> Well, possession being<br> nine points of the law,<br> I would say Kananga<br> is your problem now.<br> Thank you.<br> In fact, if I were you,<br> I'd... watch my step from now on.<br> Yeah, well, you just let me handle<br> our business with the man.<br> I got my own plans for you, baby.<br> But first<br> there's one little question<br> that he wants answers for.<br> Then you'd better ship me back<br> to the island and let him ask in person.<br> I'm not in the habit<br> of giving answers to lackeys.<br> You damn lucky you got an ear left<br> to hear the question with.<br> Which is... did you mess with that?<br> That's between Solitaire and myself...<br> and Kananga. I'll tell him when I see him.<br> You won't see sunlight<br> unless you answer!<br> I'd no idea you were so frightened of him.<br> Did you touch her?!<br> When I see Kananga.<br> Right.<br> Quite revealing.<br> Kananga: poppy grower<br> in thousands of acres<br> of well-camouflaged fields,<br> protected by the voodoo threat<br> of Baron Samedi.<br> Then there's Mr Big,<br> distributor and wholesaler through<br> a chain of Fillet Of Soul restaurants.<br> Wholesale?<br> Sell heroin, for money?!<br> My apologies. I'm sure<br> you simply give it away.<br> Excellent, Mr Bond.<br> That's precisely what I intend to do.<br> Two tons of it, to be exact.<br> When entering into<br> a fiercely competitive field,<br> one finds it advisable<br> to give away free samples.<br> Man or woman, black or white.<br> I don't discriminate.<br> Two tons of heroin with a street value<br> well over a billion dollars<br> nationally distributed free?<br> That should make a certain group of<br> families rather angry, wouldn't you say?<br> Angry?<br> Why, my dear Mr Bond,<br> it'll positively drive them<br> out of their minds.<br> - And subsequently out of the business.<br> - Quite ingenious.<br> A sort of junkies' welfare system.<br> Merely until the number of addicts<br> in the country has doubled, shall we say?<br> Then I will market that acreage<br> you blundered into the other day.<br> That heroin will be very expensive indeed,<br> leaving myself and the phone company<br> the only two going monopolies<br> in this nation for years to come.<br> And here I thought it was Solitaire<br> who did the fortune-telling.<br> Let's hope for both your sakes<br> she still can.<br> The question still stands, Mr Bond.<br> Asked by the gentleman concerned.<br> Did you touch her?<br> Well, it's not the sort of question...<br> a gentleman answers.<br> Well, having set the example,<br> I don't expect Miss Solitaire<br> to be any less the lady.<br> By the way,<br> that's a particularly handsome watch<br> you're wearing, Mr Bond.<br> - May I see it, please?<br> - You'll forgive me if I don't get up.<br> Butterhook!<br> Tee Hee.<br> On the first wrong answer<br> from Miss Solitaire,<br> you will snip the little finger<br> of Mr Bond's right hand.<br> Starting with the second wrong answer,<br> you will proceed<br> to the more... vital areas.<br> Solitaire,<br> my dear,<br> I want you to listen to me very carefully.<br> On the back of Mr Bond's watch<br> the registration number: 3-2-6-<br> Do I speak the truth?<br> You speak the truth.<br> Well,...<br> if nothing else,<br> at least I've laid your fears to rest.<br> My compliments on a splendid operation.<br> There is one thing, however, the...<br> Whisper.<br> Take him to the farm.<br> When do we start back?<br> Soon, Solitaire.<br> Soon.<br> Solitaire, why?<br> I treated you well. You lacked for nothing.<br> I don't understand what you...<br> Mr Bond's watch, my dear.<br> I gave you every break possible.<br> You had a 50-50 chance.<br> You weren't even close.<br> I had no choice.<br> Please believe me... The cards!<br> When the time came, I myself<br> would have given you love.<br> You knew that.<br> You knew that!<br> There's only one proper way<br> to deal with this.<br> And one proper time.<br> The tonnage order is nearly complete.<br> We move it out tonight.<br> And I mean tonight!<br> Mr Bond.<br> How much do you know<br> about crocodiles, Bond?<br> I've... always tried<br> to keep them at arm's length myself.<br> Cute little nippers, ain't they?<br> I don't suppose those potential<br> overnight bags are orphans.<br> Oh, no! We have<br> some moms and dads as well.<br> In fact, quite a few thousand.<br> This is the part I like best: feeding time.<br> I suspect, the highlight of the tour.<br> Some of these babies<br> live to be 200 years old.<br> Look over there.<br> That's an alligator.<br> You can always tell by its round nose.<br> There's old Albert.<br> He's a croc.<br> Got careless with him some time back,<br> and he took my whole arm off.<br> Well done, Albert!<br> They'll eat anything. Even each other.<br> Then again, sometime they can go<br> a whole year without eating.<br> I was rather counting on that.<br> There are two ways<br> to disable a crocodile, you know.<br> I... don't suppose you'd care<br> to share that information with me?<br> One way is to jam a pencil<br> into the depression hole behind his eyes.<br> And the other?<br> The other's twice as simple.<br> You just put your hand in his mouth<br> and pull his teeth out.<br> Fire!<br> Evans, get him!<br> Adam, in the car! Head him off!<br> Hector, move, damn it!<br> Bond ripped off one of our boats.<br> He's headed for the lrish Bayou.<br> The man that gets him, stays alive!<br> Now move, you mothers!<br> Toby.<br> I got me a regular Ben Hur down here.<br> Doin' 95, minimum.<br> - Need any help, JW?<br> - Hell, no!<br> You got a set of wheels<br> that just won't quit, boy!<br> If they's yours, that is.<br> You spin around, boy.<br> Ten fingers on the fender.<br> Legs apart.<br> I'm sure this ain't exactly your debut<br> at this sort of thing.<br> You picked the wrong parish<br> to haul ass through, boy.<br> Nobody cuts and runs<br> on Sheriff JW Pepper.<br> And that's him speakin' that, by the bye!<br> What the...<br> JW?<br> Soon as you nail that offendin' vehicle,<br> Miss Pearsonjust called.<br> Seems her dog's<br> foamin' all at the mouth.<br> She's got him locked up in the shed<br> and wondered ifyou'd like to<br> come over and shoot it for her.<br> You tell Miss Pearson to take a flyin'...<br> That look like a boat stuck<br> in the Sheriff's car there, Eddie?<br> Boy, where you been all your life?<br> That there's one of them new car-boats.<br> By the powers invested in me<br> by this parish,<br> I hereby do commandeer this vehicle<br> and all those persons within.<br> And that means you, smartass!<br> Unit 23 in position.<br> Ten-four, 23. Come in, 28.<br> Hey, JW. Seems like Deke Rogers<br> done got his boat stole offthe river<br> but got a new one in his swimming pool.<br> - Sheriff, get your boys offmy frequency!<br> - Give me that!<br> Now you listen to me, trooper boy!<br> We got a swamp full of Black Russians<br> drivin' boats to beat the band down here!<br> Relax, Sheriff. We've got a roadblock<br> waiting for them at Miller's Bridge.<br> Unit 26 at Miller's Bridge.<br> We're just about all set here.<br> Make that secure there! D'you hear?<br> OK, fellas. Here they come!<br> All right, out of my way!<br> I'm in charge here!<br> You two boys, come on!<br> I want those two men and<br> their boats apprehended immediately!<br> Yes, sir, Captain. I understand.<br> But, I don't know where we're gonna find<br> a boat fast enough to catch 'em.<br> Call my brother-in-law, Billy Bob. He's got<br> the fastest boat on the whole damn river.<br> Billy Bob'll sure enough fix their ass!<br> Yeah, call Billy Bob.<br> There's two boats, Billy Bob.<br> They're movin' like buttered pigs!<br> Now, I promised these boys here<br> you'd get 'em. Don't let me down.<br> Cool down, JW. I'm on my way.<br> - Want something, boy?<br> - Yes. I'd like to borrow this boat, if I may.<br> Everybody on the river<br> would like to borrow this boat.<br> Billy Bob, we've got 'em spotted.<br> They're headed for Hayley's Landing.<br> That's my brother-in-law!<br> That's Billy Bob!<br> He'll get 'em! Billy Bob'll get 'em!<br> Hot damn!<br> If one side of the Pepper family<br> don't get 'em, the other side will! Let's go!<br> If any man can show just cause why they<br> may not lawfully be joined together,<br> Iet him now speak, or else hereafter...<br> Headquarters to all units.<br> Suspects seen proceeding down<br> by Liberty towards Highway 11.<br> Proceed with caution.<br> Would you get that chicken coop<br> off the road?!<br> Did you ever think of gettin'<br> a driver's licence, boy?!<br> Are you sure that was<br> your brother-in-law, Sheriff?<br> - Felix, what are you doing here?<br> - We'll get to that later.<br> Kananga's in town. He's got your girl.<br> They just took off.<br> There's the son of a bitch! I got him!<br> What are you?<br> Some kind of doomsday machine, boy?<br> Well, we've got a cage strong enough<br> to hold an animal like you here!<br> - Captain, enlighten the sheriff, please.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> JW, let me have a word with you.<br> JW, now this fella's<br> from London, England.<br> He's an Englishman workin'<br> in cooperation with our boys.<br> - A sort of secret agent.<br> - Secret agent?!<br> On whose side?!<br> We busted the Fillet of Soul an hour ago.<br> We came up with nothing but these.<br> Kananga's clear.<br> You should have seen the size<br> of the guy on the boat with him.<br> Nine feet tall, I swear.<br> Big top hat, a cockamamie flute<br> in one hand and Solitaire in the other.<br> The incendiary bombs<br> are set for midnight.<br> Now, that gives you exactly... 30 minutes.<br> Watch out for sharks on the way back.<br> We'll see you for breakfast, Felix.<br> Good hunting!<br> You're going to need these<br> and the shark gun on the way back.<br> Seems like the party's started.<br> My regards to Baron Samedi, man -<br> right between the eyes.<br> Trouble!<br> Mr Bond! There you are!<br> And Miss Solitaire as well.<br> Hardly unexpected, but most welcome.<br> Whisper!<br> Two more glasses for our guests!<br> - What shall we drink to, Mr Bond?<br> - How about an earthquake?<br> Welcome home. Where's our boy?<br> He'll be along any time now.<br> I checked behind a rock<br> and his wet suit is gone.<br> Keep the change.<br> It is unfortunate your wet suit was found<br> only minutes before<br> the field was destroyed.<br> Don't tell me you're not insured?<br> The poppy is a very sturdy flower.<br> You have been<br> a relatively minor nuisance, in fact.<br> But this gun...<br> I find it particularly fascinating.<br> What is it?<br> A shark gun, naturally.<br> With compressed gas pellets.<br> Ingenious!<br> Don't<br> pull the pin out. The air in here<br> is foul enough already.<br> Somehow I never thought of you<br> as a poor loser.<br> I was hoping you would join me<br> to drink to the future.<br> Miss Solitaire used to know all about<br> the future. Especially predicting death.<br> An underground monorail.<br> Connected to the last refuge<br> of a scoundrel, no doubt.<br> The heroin leaves here, I take it,<br> carried somewhere by that winch.<br> Correct again, Mr Bond.<br> What a quick study you are.<br> Let me show you exactly how it works.<br> Where in hell can the man be?<br> Relax!<br> He must have got tied up somewhere.<br> These cans hold 25 pounds each.<br> There are 20 cans to a shipment,<br> packed in watertight<br> metal containers.<br> It's your show, but isn't there<br> a simpler way of drowning someone?<br> Drown, Mr Bond?<br> I doubt you'd get the chance to drown.<br> Perhaps we could try something<br> on an even simpler vein.<br> On the contrary, Mr Bond,<br> I think you'll find those wounds quite<br> fatal.<br> Whisper...<br> The gate.<br> Slowly, Whisper, slowly, slowly.<br> Let our diners assemble.<br> Look out!<br> Where's Kananga?<br> He always did have<br> an inflated opinion of himself.<br> Oh, James!<br> How do we get out of here?<br> We take the train, of course.<br> Thanks for everything, Felix.<br> See you tomorrow night at the 21 Club.<br> Why do you want to travel this way?<br> What the hell can the two of you do<br> on the train for 16 hours?<br> Say goodbye to Felix, darling.<br> Now, the first thing to learn<br> in playing gin rummy<br> is never take a card from the exposed<br> pile unless you really need it.<br> Gin.<br> James! What are you doing?<br> Just testing an old adage.<br> "Unlucky at cards..."<br> - Do hurry up, James.<br> - Won't be a moment, darling.<br> Lock the door as well on your way up,<br> would you, James?<br> After all, we wouldn't want anyone<br> to just walk in on us, would we?<br> For the first time in my life,<br> I feel like a complete woman.<br> The slightest touch of your hand...<br> I was always so afraid that<br> a part of me would stay with the past.<br> But now I know<br> there's no chance of that any longer.<br> To be able to reach out and touch you...<br> Mr Bond. It's good to see you again.<br> Well, that wasn't very funny!<br> Now what are you doing?<br> Just being disarming, darling.<br>
