That's what I did.<br> I prefer to think my office is<br> out on the street.<br> Indeed, you do.<br> Your arrest record is 400% higher<br> than any other officer.<br> Which is why it's high time<br> that such skills were put to better use.<br> - We're making you Sergeant.<br> - I see.<br> In Sandford, Gloucestershire.<br> - In where, sorry?<br> - In Sandford, Gloucestershire.<br> - That's in the country.<br> - Yes, lovely.<br> Isn't there a Sergeant's position<br> here in London?<br> No.<br> - Can I remain here as a PC?<br> - No.<br> - Do I have any choice in this?<br> - No.<br> Sergeant, I kind of like it here.<br> Well, you've always wanted<br> to transfer to the country.<br> - In 20 years or so, yes.<br> - Well done, you.<br> Hang on, I don't remember telling you that.<br> Yes, you did. You said,<br> "I'd love to settle down<br> in the country sometime, Janine."<br> I'd like to talk to the Inspector.<br> You can speak to the Inspector,<br> but I can promise you<br> he will tell you<br> exactly the same thing as I have.<br> - Hello, Nicholas. How's the hand?<br> - It's still a bit stiff.<br> - And how are things at home?<br> - I'm sorry, sir?<br> How's Janine?<br> We're no longer together, sir.<br> - Right.

I'm the Chief Inspector.<br> Well, however you spin this, there's<br> one thing you haven't taken into account.<br> And that's what the "team"<br> is gonna make of this.<br> - Hello?<br> - Janine, it's me.<br> I know. I'm at work.<br> I know, I'm outside.<br> What's the situation?<br> You know the situation.<br> We've been over this.<br> No, I... I meant here.<br> Two people involved,<br> distinct signs of a struggle.<br> Complete mess.<br> - You are talking about here?<br> - Nicholas, what do you want?<br> Well, I have something important to tell you<br> and I didn't wanna do it over the phone.<br> Janine, I've been transferred.<br> I'm moving away for a while.<br> I'm not Janine.<br> Janine, I've been transferred.<br> I'm moving away for a while.<br> I know.

It's only ever about the job.<br> - It's all you care about.<br> - That's not true.<br> No, you're right,<br> you do have that rubber plant.<br> - It's a Japanese Peace Lily.<br> - You just can't switch off, Nicholas.<br> And until you find a person you care<br> about more than your job, you never will.<br> Besides, you were the one<br> who suggested we take a break.<br> Yes, well,<br> guilty people often make the first move.<br> Actually, there's something<br> I need to tell you.<br> - You're seeing someone else.<br> - Yes.

Cheerio.<br> Nicholas, Frank again.<br> One other thing about your cottage.<br> It's not ready.<br> It would appear the heavens have opened.<br> - I was hoping to check in.<br> - Check in?<br> But you've always been here.<br> - Excuse me?<br> - Oh, I'm sorry.<br> I thought you were my husband.<br> - You must be Sergeant Angel.<br> - Yes, I am.<br> I'm Joyce Cooper.<br> I trust you had a pleasant trip.

Wonderful.<br> Now, we've put you in the Castle Suite.<br> Bernard will escort you up there.<br> Well, actually,<br> I could probably make my own way up. Hag.<br> I beg your pardon?<br> "Evil old woman considered<br> frightful or ugly." It's 12 down.<br> Oh, bless you.<br> - Pint of lager, please, Mary.<br> - Right you are, my love.<br> Yes, sir, what can I get you?<br> Could I have a glass<br> of the cranberry juice, please?<br> Certainly.<br> Now, you wouldn't, by any chance,<br> be the new policeman?<br> Police officer, yes. I'm Nicholas Angel.<br> - I'm Roy Porter. This is my wife Mary.<br> - Mary.<br> Welcome to Sandford.<br> If there's anything you need,<br> just let us know.<br> Thank you. Could I borrow your newspaper?<br> It's not ours, love.<br> We're not big fans of the local fish wrapper,<br> are we, Mare?<br> - They listed her age as 55.<br> - When I'm actually 53.<br> Fifty-three.<br> - Pint of lager, please, Mary.<br> - Right you are, my love.<br> - Excuse me.<br> - What?<br> - When's your birthday?<br> - Twenty-second of February.<br> - What year?<br> - Every year.<br> Get out.<br> - When's your birthday?<br> - Eighth of May, 1969.<br> - You're 37?<br> - Yeah.<br> Get out.<br> When's your birthday?<br> Out.<br> - Is there a problem, Officer?<br> - Yes, there is, Mr. Porter.<br> It would appear a number<br> of your patrons are under age.<br> Well, a few of them may be<br> a month or two south of proper.<br> But if they're in here,<br> it stops them getting into trouble out there.<br> Yeah, the way we see it,<br> it's all for the greater good.<br> The greater good.<br> Well, that's as may be,<br> but the law's the law and they'll have to go.<br> - Another cranberry juice?<br> - I'm fine, thank you.<br> I hope you're not planning on driving that.<br> No.<br> Right. I'm taking you to the station.<br> Where is it?<br> What?<br> Move.<br> "Nicholas Angel."<br> - Oh, when did you start?<br> - Tomorrow.<br> Well, I see you've already arrested<br> the whole village.<br> Not exactly.<br> - You in for the night?<br> - Go on, four's free.<br> - Hey, now, I need to speak to him.<br> - He'll be no use till the morning.<br> I see.<br> You really want to process all this lot?<br> - My pen's running out.<br> - Not a problem.<br> - Morning, Sergeant.<br> - Morning.<br> Morning.<br> Morning, Sergeant.<br> Morning, Sergeant.<br> - Lock me up.<br> - I'm sorry?<br> I'm a slasher and I must be stopped.<br> - You're a what?<br> - A slasher of prices.<br> Just kidding. I'm Simon Skinner.<br> I run the local supermarch.<br> Drop in and see me sometime.<br> My discounts are criminal.<br> Catch me later!<br> Morning, Sergeant.<br> Morning, Sergeant.<br> Could you tell the Inspector<br> I've arrived, please?<br> No.<br> Why?<br> He's not in yet.<br> - Well, how's our guest?<br> - Guest?<br> - The inebriate in cell four.<br> - I don't know. Nobody tells me nothing.<br> Can I get cell four open, please?<br> Danny, can you open four?<br> - He's gone.<br> - Oh, my God. Who's gone?<br> - Why are you dressed like a police officer?<br> - Because I am one.<br> Sergeant Angel, at last. Frank Butterman.<br> - I see you've already met my boy.<br> - Yes.<br> Do forgive me.<br> I'm something of a Wild West nut.<br> Speaking of which, that was a fair<br> few outlaws you rounded up last night.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> I admire your enthusiasm<br> and far be it from me to stifle your flair,<br> but this isn't London.<br> Oh, yes, please, Danny.<br> With respect, sir,<br> geographical location shouldn't factor<br> in the application of the law.<br> No, thanks.<br> Statistically, Sandford is<br> the safest village in the country.<br> But that doesn't mean<br> it requires anything less<br> than a careful and considered approach.<br> There's a reason we accommodate<br> a few of the younglings at the pub.<br> - The greater good?<br> - The greater good. Precisely.<br> Your predecessor assumed<br> that rural policing was easy.<br> Ended up having a nervous breakdown.<br> And Sergeant Popwell was<br> an exceptional officer, truly exceptional.<br> And he had one thing you haven't got.<br> - What's that, sir?<br> - A great big bushy beard.<br> Come on, let's have a mosey around.<br> Locker room.<br> Riot room.<br> Evidence room.<br> Now, how about a trip to the Andes?<br> Detective Sergeant Wainwright<br> and Detective Constable Cartwright.<br> Don't get up.<br> I expect you're wondering<br> why we call them the Andes.<br> - They're both called Andrew?<br> - They said you were good.<br> Also, because talking to them is<br> an uphill struggle, isn't it, Dad?<br> - Fuck off!<br> - Thank you, Danny.<br> And this is where it all happens.<br> That is Sergeant Tony Fisher.<br> PC Bob Walker.<br> And that is Saxon.<br> And this is one Doris Thatcher.<br> - She's our only policewoman.<br> - She's not a policewoman.<br> - Yeah, she is. I've seen her bra.<br> - She's a police officer.<br> Being a woman has nothing to do with it.<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> Comes in handy every so often.<br> I could've given you the tour.<br> I've been round the station a few times.<br> And what's upstairs?<br> Well, well, well, I see we have visitors.<br> Nicholas, this is Tom Weaver.<br> Civilian liaison<br> with the Neighborhood Watch Alliance.<br> You'll find that we run<br> a very tight ship here.<br> From this command center<br> I can see what the whole village is up to.<br> I must say I was rather admiring<br> your handiwork last night.<br> It's a pity you didn't do the same<br> to those bloody hoodies.<br> Hanging around. Loitering. Sitting.<br> Actually, I did notice some minor graffiti<br> on the fountain.<br> Graffiti? They've gotta be dealt with, Frank.<br> They're nippers, Tom. They'll come round.<br> Which reminds me,<br> our friend, The Living Statue,<br> was here on Saturday.<br> If we don't come down hard<br> on these clowns,<br> - we are gonna be up to our balls in jugglers.<br> - We'll get right onto it, Tom.<br> We like to let them think they run the place.<br> Well, that's that.<br> Unless there's anything<br> you're unclear about?<br> Yes, sir.<br> Why is everybody eating chocolate cake?<br> The Black Forest gateau is on Danny.<br> As punishment for his little indiscretion.<br> His...<br> Sir, I don't think driving under the influence<br> can be called a "little indiscretion."<br> No, the gateau is for misplacing<br> his helmet the other week.<br> Last night's incident will require<br> something rather more serious.<br> - Good.<br> - Do you like ice-cream?<br> I'm sorry, sir, I don't follow.<br> Let's just say that we won't be short<br> of Chunky Monkey for the next month.<br> Dad.<br> Now, since it's your first day<br> and it's 11:30, I'd say that's lunch.<br> So, what made you choose Sandford then,<br> Sergeant Angel?<br> It wasn't actually my choice.<br> Oh, right, right, wasn't your choice to come<br> down here and tell me how to do my job.<br> Our jobs.<br> Yeah.<br> Look, I can assure you it wasn't<br> my intention to upset the apple cart.<br> Yeah, 'cause we all sell apples round here,<br> don't we?<br> - Your dad sells apples, Andy.<br> - And raspberries.<br> I bet you can't wait to jump<br> into Sergeant Popwell's grave.<br> I'm not jumping into anyone's grave.<br> - You got a mustache.<br> - I know.<br> - Why have you got your stab vest on?<br> - It's a requirement.<br> In the city maybe.<br> Nobody's gonna stab you in here, Sergeant.<br> Not a member of the public anyhow.<br> - Have you been stabbed, Sergeant Fisher?<br> - No.<br> Well, I have.<br> And I can assure you<br> it is not in the least bit amusing.<br> Have you seen a lot of action,<br> Sergeant Angel?<br> I've experienced my fair share, yes.<br> - Did you cook any fools?<br> - Excuse me?<br> Did you shoot anybody?<br> He shot a crack head with a Kalashnikov.<br> - Where did you get that?<br> - The offender had the Kalashnikov.<br> Where'd he get that?<br> You do know there are more guns<br> in the country than there are in the city?<br> Everybody and their mums<br> is packing round here.<br> - Like who?<br> - Farmers.<br> - Who else?<br> - Farmers's mums.<br> What's it like being stabbed?<br> It was the single most painful<br> experience of my life.<br> What was the second most painful?<br> You ever fired two guns<br> whilst jumping through the air?<br> No.<br> You ever fired one gun<br> whilst jumping through the air?<br> No.<br> - Ever been in a high speed pursuit?<br> - Yes, I have.<br> You ever fired a gun<br> whilst in a high speed pursuit?<br> No.<br> Annette,<br> that Sergeant Angel's coming into your shop.<br> Get a look at his arse.<br> - What about Lethal Weapon?<br> - No.<br> - You've seen Die Hard, though?<br> - No.<br> - Bad Boys II?<br> - No.<br> You ain't seen Bad Boys II?<br> - Hell of a day, huh?<br> - Yeah.<br> - Same again tomorrow?<br> - Yeah.<br> Amanda Paver,<br> headmistress of Sandford Primary.<br> How do you do, Sergeant?<br> - Simon Skinner, I believe you've met.<br> - Oh, we're already firm friends.<br> Oh, please, please, come with me, will you?<br> This is Leslie Tiller,<br> whose horticultural expertise<br> has helped put Sandford on the map.<br> - She's ever so good.<br> - Oh, go on.<br> This is James Reaper,<br> who owns Brannigan Farm.<br> I hear you're quite the marksman.<br> Perhaps you might like to join us<br> for a shoot one day.<br> Well, I haven't held a firearm<br> for over two years, Mr. Reaper.<br> I'd quite like to keep it that way.<br> You will be popular with the local birds.<br> Birds.<br> Nicholas, hello.

I'm...<br> I'm open to the concept of religion,<br> I'm just not entirely convinced by it.<br> - You're an agnostic?<br> - I think I have a cream for that.<br> Robin Hatcher, our resident sawbones.<br> Hopefully we won't see too much<br> of each other over the coming months.<br> Well, all that remains is to welcome you<br> to the weekly meeting<br> of the Neighborhood Watch Alliance.<br> Now, quick announcement before we begin.<br> Janet Barker has just given birth to twins.<br> So, congratulations to her.<br> - Tom?<br> - Thanks, Joyce.<br> Now.<br> I am sure that all of you will have noticed<br> the return of a blight to our streets.<br> It's made all the more disturbing as<br> the Village of the Year contest looms.<br> I refer, of course,<br> to the extremely irritating Living Statue.<br> Police work<br> is as much about preventing crime<br> as it is about fighting crime.<br> Most importantly,<br> it is about procedural correctness<br> in the execution<br> of unquestionable moral authority.<br> Any questions?<br> Yes.<br> Is it true that there is a place<br> in a man's head<br> that if you shoot it, it will blow up?<br> Hi, hi, Tim Messenger.<br> Can I get a quick shot<br> for the Sandford Citizen?<br> Okay.<br> How about you put the teacher<br> in handcuffs?<br> I don't think that gives off the right signals.<br> Too cheesy-pie.

Mop it up.<br> - Yarp.<br> - Mr. Skinner, is there a problem?<br> - No, no, no, no.<br> I simply wanted to say how lovely it is<br> to see you supporting your local store.<br> Well, that's quite all right.<br> All too many have defected<br> to the big Megamart in Buford Abbey.<br> May their heads be struck<br> from their shoulders for such disloyalty.<br> Yes, well, I am on duty,<br> so if you'll excuse me.<br> Of course. I simply spied you loitering<br> in organic produce<br> and assumed you had time on your hands.<br> Well, maybe I'm not the one<br> you should be keeping an eye on.<br> That's the Fridge Magnate.<br> His name's George Merchant.<br> Made a fortune in kitchen goods.<br> Built that monstrosity on Norris Avenue.<br> Actually, I wasn't talking about him.<br> I was talking about him.<br> Excuse me.<br> Excuse me.<br> "Meet the cop that can't be stopped."<br> Tosser!<br> Trouble in the high street.<br> Sergeant Angel's having a spot of bother.<br> Roger that.<br> Morning, Sergeant.<br> You mothers.<br> - Let's cut through here.

Car chases.<br> Proper action and shit.<br> Police work is not about<br> proper action or shit.<br> Twenty-nine.<br> If you had paid attention to me in school,<br> you'd understand that it's not all about<br> gun fights and car chases.<br> Fire up the roof.<br> That was brilliant.<br> Was I going a tad fast, Officer?<br> Yes, you were, Mr. Blower.<br> Well, now, you see,<br> we are staging a homage<br> to William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet<br> and I'm a little late for the dress rehearsal.<br> I'm playing the eponymous hero, you see.<br> Romeo not Juliet.<br> - What are you writing?<br> - Everything you're saying.<br> I might need to refer to it later.<br> Now, Officer, I am a respected solicitor<br> so there's no need to...<br> Just stop writing, will you?<br> Look, I'm merely trying to explain<br> why I might have exceeded the speed limit.<br> You're playing the male lead<br> in a homage to William Shakespeare's<br> Romeo and Juliet<br> and you're late for the dress rehearsal.<br> You think this is sufficient reason<br> to travel at 48 in a 30 zone?<br> - Well, I...<br> - To flout speed limits<br> - specifically put in place to save lives.<br> - Just, look, this is preposterous.<br> - "Preposterous."<br> - Look, just stop writing!<br> "Stop writing."<br> Look, you're right, I apologize.<br> - See what I did there?<br> - You hypnotized him.<br> No, I used this.<br> This is the most important piece<br> of equipment you will ever own.<br> This notebook has saved my skin<br> more times than I care to mention.<br> You should think<br> about using yours more often.<br> - I do use mine.<br> - Show me.<br> - That's just extraordinary.<br> - You should see the one on the other side.<br> - What are you up to tonight?<br> - I have to water my Peace Lily.<br> Thought you might wanna do something.<br> - What exactly were you thinking?<br> - Don't know.

So...<br> Yeah, we can't accept gifts from<br> someone we've officially rebuked so...<br> Jog on.<br> Congratulations to you and to Mrs. Blower.<br> Oh, this is not my wife.<br> This is Miss Draper. My leading lady.<br> Eve works in the local council, Sergeant.<br> Quite the lady in the know.<br> - I am not.<br> - Nonsense.<br> I'm sure if we bashed your head in, all sorts<br> of secrets would come tumbling out.<br> Romeo, Romeo, a pint of bitter for Romeo?<br> Thank you very much for coming, George.<br> Excuse us.<br> A pleasure, my liege.<br> - Eve's nice, ain't she?<br> - She certainly has a distinctive laugh.<br> She was in my year at school.<br> Always had a thing for her.<br> She clearly has a thing for older men.<br> What, with Martin Blower? No way!<br> We just sat through three hours<br> of so-called acting, Constable,<br> their kiss was<br> the only convincing moment in it.<br> Hey, now you come to mention it,<br> I too have reason to believe<br> she favors the older gent.<br> Really? How so?<br> Marcus Carter's big brother said<br> he'd fingered her up the duck pond.<br> Oh, Officers.<br> Again let me extend<br> my sincere apologies for earlier.<br> That's quite all right, Mr. Blower. Drive safe.<br> "Drive safe." Oh, my God.<br> You know that's the bloke<br> we done for speeding earlier.<br> Yeah. Hopefully,<br> that's the last we'll see of him.<br> Who is it?<br> We haven't got long.<br> To us.<br> Who is it?<br> Yeah?<br> - ...decaffeinated?<br> - Decaffeinated?<br> Little Brian Libby found them,<br> out on his paper round.<br> Oh, he'll be having nightmares for a while.<br> Must have hit the sign at some speed.<br> Took the whole top off.<br> - I've had my top off in this lay-by.<br> - Tits.<br> Most likely lost control,<br> left the road there and then ended up here.<br> So, what do we reckon?<br> Sergeant Angel?<br> Well, we should get a proper cordon off,<br> screen the remains from public view.<br> Close down the road<br> until the ambulance crew arrives,<br> whereupon we should open<br> a single lane of traffic and ease congestion.<br> Very good.<br> What he said.<br> - What happened, Danny?<br> - Car accident.<br> Nasty way to go.<br> Constable, official vocab guidelines state<br> we no longer refer to these incidents<br> as "accidents," they're now "collisions."<br> Right.<br> "For never was there a story of more woe.<br> Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."<br> - Excuse me?<br> - Martin and Eve. Such a tragedy.<br> Mr. Skinner, do you mind telling me<br> how you know the identity<br> of the persons involved?<br> You know how it is. News travels fast.<br> A love struck Romeo<br> sings a streetsus serenade<br> - What happened, Danny?<br> - Traffic collision.<br> Hey, why can't we say "accident" again?<br> Because "accident" implies<br> there's nobody to blame.<br> Put a sock in it, town mouse.<br> Yeah, you wanna be a big cop in<br> a small town, fuck off up the model village.<br> I'm just saying,<br> things aren't always as simple as they look.<br> Most times they are.<br> Let's just wait till Doctor Hatcher<br> comes back with something,<br> before you go jumping the Kalashnikov.<br> All right, in the meantime, why don't you<br> check out a few of Martin Blower's clients?<br> Martin Blower represents<br> damn near most of the village.<br> Did you want us to go through<br> the whole phone book?<br> Yeah, or put a call into Aaron A. Aaronson,<br> shall we?<br> Please, don't be childish.<br> At least consider interviewing the widow.<br> Martin Blower was clearly having<br> an affair with Eve Draper.<br> Oh, and how did you establish that?<br> 'Cause we sat through three hours<br> of so-called acting last night,<br> and the kiss was<br> the only convincing moment in it.<br> All right, pipe down, big one.<br> Here, what else you got,<br> Crockett and Tubby?<br> - Skid marks.<br> - Now who's being childish?<br> There were no skid marks at the scene.<br> Doesn't it seem a little strange that<br> Martin Blower would lose control of his car<br> and not think to apply the brakes?<br> If there were no skid marks it follows<br> that for 300 yards both driver and passenger<br> did nothing to prevent their fate.<br> You don't have to be a detective<br> to work that out!<br> Yeah.<br> - Are you causing trouble?<br> - Yes, they are.<br> Well, a spot of bother up at Ellroy Farm.<br> Old Arthur Webley's been clipping<br> hedgerows that don't belong to him.<br> - Yes, sir?<br> - That's it.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Why do we need the dog?<br> - It's not the dog we need.<br> Right.<br> What did he say?<br> - What did he say?<br> - He said, "An 'edge is an 'edge.<br> "He only chopped it down<br> 'cause it spoilt his view.<br> "What's Reaper moaning about?"<br> Right.<br> Look, I appreciate your position,<br> Mr. Webley,<br> but you can't go around chopping down<br> other people's hedges without permission.<br> "Yes, I suppose."<br> Thank you.<br> All right.<br> Mr. Webley,<br> I trust you have a license for that firearm?<br> He does for this one.<br> What do you mean by "this one"?<br> By the power of Grey Skull.<br> Where on earth did you get these?<br> - Found them.<br> - He found them!<br> - And what is this?<br> - Sea mine.<br> Sea mine.<br> Well, Mr. Webley,<br> this is an extremely dangerous collection.<br> It's a wonder nobody's been hurt before.<br> No, it's just a lot of junk.<br> Move, move, move!<br> - You what?<br> - No, apparently it's been deactivated. Over.<br> That's right, deactivated!<br> - It's not live.<br> - It looks live.<br> All right.<br> That was quite an impressive haul today,<br> Constable Butterman.<br> Well, you know, I mean, maybe<br> we should do something to celebrate.<br> Unless you gotta water your Peace Lily.<br> - What exactly did you have in mind?<br> - I don't know. Pub?<br> Right you are, my love.<br> Yes, sirs, what can I get you?<br> Pint of lager, please, Roy.<br> And what can I get you<br> that isn't a cranberry juice?<br> - I don't really wanna get drunk.<br> - You can get a little drunk.<br> - Okay, I'll have one.<br> - Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.<br> Mr. Porter, what's your wine selection?<br> Oh, we got red or white.<br> - I'll have a pint of lager, please.<br> - Yeah, Roy.<br> - Any news from earlier?<br> - Yeah. CSI found nothing.<br> Doctor Hatcher reported no misadventure<br> and Mrs. Blower has four alibis.<br> Now, come on, Sergeant, it's not your job<br> to investigate this incident, is it?<br> Is it?<br> - No, it isn't.<br> - No, it isn't.<br> - You don't switch off, do you?<br> - You sound like my ex.<br> - Well, you are always thinking away.<br> - It's what I do.<br> - Don't get me wrong. I think it's amazing.<br> - Really?<br> I mean,<br> what made you wanna be a policeman?<br> Officer.<br> What made you wanna be<br> a policeman-officer?<br> I don't remember a time<br> when I didn't wanna be a police officer.<br> Apart from the summer of 1979<br> when I wanted to be Kermit the Frog.<br> It all started with my Uncle Derek.<br> He was a Sergeant in the Met.<br> He bought me a police pedal car<br> when I was five.<br> I rode round in it every second I was awake.<br> Arresting kids twice my size<br> for littering and spitting.<br> I got beaten up a lot when I was young<br> but it didn't stop me.<br> I wanted to be like Uncle Derek.<br> He sounds like a good bloke.<br> Actually, he was arrested<br> for selling drugs to students.<br> What a cunt.<br> Probably bought the pedal car<br> with the proceeds.<br> Needless to say I never went near it again.<br> I just let it rust.<br> But I never forgot<br> the clear sense of right and wrong<br> that I felt at the wheel of that pedal car.<br> I had to prove to myself<br> that the law could be proper<br> and righteous<br> and for the good of humankind.<br> It was from that moment,<br> I was destined to be a police officer.<br> - Shame.<br> - How so?<br> I think you would've made a great muppet.<br> What about you? What made you<br> wanna become a police officer?<br> I don't know. Dad does it.<br> I think after my mum died, it's what<br> he wanted, you know, keep me close by.<br> - Do you mind if I ask how she died?<br> - Traffic collision.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Never mind. Hey, watch this.<br> - Jesus Christ!<br> - Oh, my eye!<br> Ta-da!<br> Hey, come on, silly bollocks, get them in.<br> - 777.<br> - Mr. Skinner.<br> - You know George Merchant, don't you?<br> - Evening, Officer.<br> Yes, we were just discussing the accident.<br> I'd come to know Martin<br> and Eve very well of late.<br> Such a loss.<br> What say we drink to their demise?<br> Shouldn't that be "drink to their memories"?<br> Of course. Cheers.<br> I must go to the little boys' room.<br> - I'm all right!<br> - "Little" being the operative word.<br> Oh, he'll be in bits tomorrow.<br> I think somebody needs to go home.<br> - I'm... I'm not that drunk, sir.<br> - Not you. Him.<br> What?<br> Hey, we did get a little drunk.<br> Did you get it?<br> 'Cause he's... He's little and he's drunk.<br> Oh, good grief.<br> It's hardly in keeping<br> with the village's rustic esthetic, is it?<br> - How much do I owe you?<br> - Twenty quid.<br> There you go.<br> - And there's your change.<br> - God bless you.<br> Bye-bye.<br> I'm all right.<br> I would not wanna be him in the morning.<br> Well, this is me.<br> Well, I shall see you in the morning.<br> Unless you wanna come in<br> for a cup of coffee?<br> - I don't drink coffee.<br> - Tea?<br> No caffeine after midday.<br> How about another beer?<br> Oh, dear.<br> - When did you move in?<br> - About five years ago.<br> - You should get some house plants.<br> - Oh, yeah, yeah.<br> Yeah. I've been tending my Peace Lily<br> for about three years now.<br> It oxygenates the room,<br> helps you think, relieves stress.<br> Its needs are simple.<br> Janine used to say I love my Lily<br> more than I loved her.<br> - Is that why you split up?<br> - What?<br> - 'Cause you did it with a plant?<br> - No, no, no.<br> It was more about me being<br> obsessed with the job.<br> That's good though, right?<br> Is it though?<br> I did miss a few dinners.<br> You know, parties, a birthday or two.<br> - Listen, mate, I...<br> - Her dad's funeral.<br> - I just wanna be good at what I do.<br> - You are good at what you do.<br> You've just gotta learn to switch off<br> that big old melon of yours.<br> That's the whole problem, Danny.<br> I don't think I know how.<br> I can show you how.<br> By the power of Grey Skull.<br> Point Break or Bad Boys II?<br> Which one do you think I'll prefer?<br> No, I mean which one<br> do you wanna watch first?<br> You are pulling my leg?<br> What did you think of that?<br> Well, I won't argue<br> that it was a no holds barred,<br> adrenalin fueled thrill ride<br> but there's no way you could perpetrate<br> that amount of carnage and mayhem and not<br> incur a considerable amount of paperwork.<br> That is nothing, man.<br> This is about to go off.<br> This shit just got real.<br> Nasty way to go.<br> I think our Mr. Merchant tried to have<br> a little fry up and left the gas on.<br> Spends his whole life<br> devoted to the refrigerator<br> then gets killed by an oven.<br> I told him several times,<br> you shouldn't eat late at night.<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> I quite like a little midnight gobble.<br> Cocks.<br> So, what do we reckon? Angel?<br> Help me.<br> Okay, we get a proper cordon up,<br> we let the fire crews finish their stuff,<br> and then we get forensics in<br> to do a thorough sweep of the house.<br> Very good. What he said.<br> Sergeant Angel, hi-hi. A quick word?<br> Mr. Messenger,<br> a statement will be issued shortly.<br> Actually, I just wanted to ask,<br> "What's your perfect Sunday?"<br> I'll deal with the press, Sergeant.<br> Now, my perfect Sunday<br> is a lovely long lie in...<br> Fire to destroy all you've done<br> Like in the films.<br> Something like,<br> something out of Backdraft.<br> - What are you thinking? Foul play?<br> - Maybe.<br> We're just hoping to talk to the last people<br> to see Mr. Merchant alive.<br> Namely a Sergeant Knickerless Asswipe<br> and a Constable Fanny Batterbum.<br> - That's us.<br> - Why is this such a big joke to you?<br> Three people have died in a week.<br> Oh, come on, Doctor Sherlock,<br> they were accidents.<br> People have accidents every day.<br> - The victims knew each other.<br> - Everyone knows everyone round here.<br> Yeah. If you didn't see anything suspicious,<br> then who did?<br> It's a bit of a blind spot, I'm afraid.<br> We just catch the very edge<br> of the explosion.<br> Nasty way to go.<br> - There was something took my eye.<br> - Really? What's that?<br> Sandford's most wanted.<br> There you go. It was the swan all along.<br> - This is not funny, Detective!<br> - Oh, give over, Miss Marples.<br> Yeah, you do your job<br> and we'll do ours, eh?<br> Yeah. Haven't you got<br> a church fete to look after?<br> No, I have not!<br> Actually.<br> Testing. Testing.<br> Someone's in for a surprise at 3:00,<br> ladies and gentlemen.<br> It's the raffle with<br> a very special guest presenter.<br> Out in the country<br> Far from all the sorts of noise of the city<br> There's a village green<br> It's been a long time since I last set eyes<br> On the church with a steeple<br> That's me after a couple of pints.<br> Splat the rat.<br> Splat the rat.<br> Splat the rat.<br> Shark!<br> Seen any murderings, Nicholarse?<br> Come on, boys.<br> Leave Sergeant Angel alone, he's working.<br> Sorry, Chief,<br> won't waste any more police time.<br> Have a nice time.<br> Actually, Nicholas,<br> you might as well take a break.<br> Hey, great. I've got something to show you.<br> - This is a rifle range.<br> - You'll be really good at it.<br> Feeling lucky, Sergeant?<br> Three cans wins you the squeaky bunny,<br> five cans gets you the floppy lion.<br> Take out all the little people,<br> you get to waltz off with the cuddly monkey.<br> I thought I made it clear to you<br> how I feel about firearms.<br> It's only an air rifle.<br> Sergeant.<br> Dear Lord!<br> That was amazing.<br> - Thank you, Danny.<br> - I can't believe I shot someone.<br> - He's a doctor, he can deal with it.<br> - I never shot anyone before.<br> Danny, believe me,<br> it's not something you ever get used to.<br> Yeah. Maybe we should<br> go on the bouncy castle.<br> Take our minds off of it.<br> - Sergeant Angel, hi-hi.<br> - Mr. Messenger.<br> I need to talk to you<br> about George Merchant. Alone.<br> Churchyard. 3:00.<br> What do you think he wants?<br> Would<br> Sergeant Angel come to the stage, please?<br> Here to announce the winners is the newest<br> addition to the Sandford Police Force.<br> Service.<br> Sergeant Nicholas Angel.<br> - Prick.<br> - Wanker.<br> Hello. Hello.<br> The first name is Simon Skinner.<br> He's in the loo.<br> Too much of Joyce's lemonade, perhaps.<br> And the next name is...<br> Tim, your number's up.<br> Excuse me. Excuse me.<br> Hi-hi.<br> Oh, no!<br> Stand back, stand back!<br> There's been a terrible accident.<br> - Accident?<br> - Just an accident.<br> It's all right, it's all right.<br> There's nothing to see.<br> Come on, everybody. It's all right.<br> It's just an accident.<br> Nicholas, what is it?<br> Sir, I think all these deaths are linked.<br> I think Tim Messenger was murdered.<br> - Who could do something like this?<br> - Maybe it was the swan.<br> - Apparently, they can break a man's arm.<br> - Or blow up a man's house.<br> - Listen, you pair of...<br> - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Nicholas.<br> Now, let me get this straight.<br> - Are you saying that this is a crime scene?<br> - Yes, sir, I am.<br> Very well.<br> - Detectives.<br> - Sir.<br> Start interviewing everyone<br> who was at the fete.<br> Oh, he's got shorts on.<br> - Sergeant Fisher?<br> - What?<br> - Secure the area.<br> - What?<br> - PC Thatcher?<br> - Yes, love?<br> Get the CSI down here.<br> PC Walker?<br> Patrol the churchyard with Saxon.<br> Nicholas, Danny, you know what to do.<br> Do you really think this is murder?<br> I just don't think we should rule it out,<br> that's all.<br> Yeah. I think you're right.<br> I think you're talking a load of old shit.<br> He thinks you're talking a load of shit.<br> Swings and roundabouts, isn't it?<br> Pain in the arse.<br> - Did you find anything?<br> - Yeah.<br> I was extremely shocked<br> when I looked at my watch<br> and discovered that I should be in the pub.<br> Did you go to his house?<br> Did you read his articles?<br> If you wanna wade through every copy of<br> the Sandford bloody Citizen, be our guest.<br> It's your job, isn't it? Detect!<br> This ain't the city, Mr. Angel.<br> Not everyone's a murdering psychopath.<br> It's high time you realized that.<br> You and your monkey.<br> Did he mean me or that?<br> Oh, maybe we should go home.<br> - What do you mean?<br> - Well, there's nothing going on, is there?<br> Have you listened to anything that I've said?<br> What do you mean?<br> Is anything I've told you<br> in the last two weeks<br> - sunk into that thick skull of yours?<br> - Yeah.<br> Has it? Like what?<br> You said I could be<br> an amazing policeman-officer.<br> There's always something going on, Danny.<br> And you won't be an amazing police officer<br> until you understand that.<br> Well, I remembered something else<br> you said and all.<br> - Oh, did you now?<br> - Yeah.<br> You don't know how to switch off!<br> Well, if you wanna wade through every copy<br> of the Sandford bloody Citizen,<br> be our guest.<br> - Morning, Constable.<br> - All right?<br> Thanks for the monkey.<br> - Yours, isn't it?<br> - I won it for you.<br> Danny, I think I'm on to something.<br> - Are you?<br> - Yes.<br> And I think with a little deliberation<br> we can figure out what links these deaths.<br> - We?<br> - Come on, partner. Let's go to work.<br> Oh, oh, Sergeant Angel?<br> - Someone from London called for you.<br> - Tell them I'll call them back.<br> - Tim Messenger.<br> - Go.<br> Editor and journalist<br> at The Sandford Citizen.<br> - Fondness for puns.<br> - Go on.<br> - Terrible speller.<br> - Oh, yeah?<br> Nevertheless had uncovered<br> important information about...<br> - George Merchant.<br> - Self-made millionaire.<br> Fancied himself as a property developer.<br> - Said he had big plans for Sandford.<br> - Pissed on the floor in The Crown.<br> But more importantly,<br> was a good friend and client of...<br> - Martin Blower.<br> - Respected solicitor.<br> - Affirmatron.<br> - Leading light of the local drama society.<br> - Bad actor.<br> - Undoubtedly.<br> - Bad driver.<br> - Not necessarily.<br> - Cheated on his missus.<br> - Most certainly.<br> - And we both know who with.<br> - Eve Draper.<br> - Blower's leading lady. Distinctive laugh.<br> - True.<br> - Favored older men.<br> - Fingered.<br> - Worked at?<br> - Council.<br> - More specifically?<br> - Department of Planning and Development.<br> Where George Merchant secured permission<br> to build his dubious mansion<br> on Norris Avenue.<br> So...<br> Maybe they were all accidents.<br> People have accidents every day.<br> - What are you two up to?<br> - Nothing.<br> Well, look sharp.<br> - There's been reports of a fire in the station.<br> - What?<br> Happy birthday to you<br> Happy birthday to you<br> - Danny, why didn't you say something?<br> - We were working, weren't we?<br> - Hey, where are you going?<br> - Personal errand.<br> Hello, Miss Tiller.<br> I was wondering,<br> do you have any Japanese Peace Lilies?<br> Of course.<br> I was just about to pop off, actually.<br> I can never find my scissors.<br> - Is this for someone special?<br> - Yes. Yes, it is.<br> - Are you going somewhere, Miss Tiller?<br> - Yes. I'm moving away.<br> And why the move,<br> if you don't mind me asking?<br> - Well, just between you and I...<br> - Yes?<br> - You know that fella who blew up?<br> - George Merchant.<br> Well, George Merchant, God rest him,<br> wanted to buy this land,<br> so he sends round his legal fella,<br> Martin Blower, God rest him,<br> and I thought I might take them up on it.<br> I haven't really got that much family<br> round here, save for Cousin Sissy.<br> So I thought I might take them up<br> on the offer and move to Buford Abbey.<br> Would you like a card with this?<br> No, sorry, you were talking about the offer?<br> Well, it turns out that Martin Blower,<br> God rest him,<br> knew where the new bypass road is going<br> because he was knocking off Eve Draper<br> from the council, God rest her,<br> and then that reporter, God rest him,<br> finds out about the route<br> and tells me this land's very valuable.<br> Ten times what George Merchant and<br> Martin Blower, God rest them, offered me.<br> So, with them having passed on,<br> I decided to sell it on myself<br> to some folks from the city<br> that Martin, George and Eve,<br> God rest the lot of them,<br> had been talking to.<br> Apparently, they want to build<br> a big shopping center or something.<br> Of course, Cousin Sissy won't be<br> too happy about that,<br> but as far as I'm concerned,<br> Cousin Sissy can go and fuck...<br> Would you just excuse me,<br> for just one second?<br> Stop!<br> In the name of the law!<br> Hang about, hang about.<br> You're saying this wasn't an accident?<br> Leslie Tiller was fucking murdered!<br> - What, just like Tim Messenger?<br> - Yes!<br> - And George Merchant?<br> - Yes!<br> - And Eve Draper?<br> - Yes!<br> - And Martin Blower?<br> - No, actually.<br> - Really?<br> - 'Course he fucking was!<br> Thank you, Danny.<br> Oh, murder, murder, murder.<br> Change the fucking record.<br> Thank you, Andy.<br> Come on, Sergeant, you've gotta accept<br> it was just another nasty accident.<br> What are you suggesting?<br> That Leslie Tiller tripped<br> and fell on her own shears?<br> Ben Fletcher fell<br> on his pitchfork the other week.<br> Yeah, accidents happen all the time.<br> What makes you think it was murder?<br> - Because I was there!<br> - There's a point.<br> Why were you there?<br> I was buying Constable Butterman<br> a Japanese Peace Lily for his birthday.<br> What absolute horseshit.<br> I chased a suspect from the scene.<br> Innocent people don't run!<br> Here, maybe it was our old friend,<br> the cactus thief.<br> Oh, yeah, he was a prickly customer,<br> weren't he?<br> Am I going completely mad?<br> Maybe you are.<br> Maybe you did it.<br> Yeah, seeing as how you're such<br> a big fan of murder.<br> - What the...<br> - Sergeant Angel?<br> Yes! Sir.<br> Nicholas, Nicholas, Nicholas.<br> What am I going to do with you?<br> - Sir, you have to understand...<br> - No, you have to understand.<br> The boys here aren't used<br> to the concepts you're bandying about.<br> The "M" word, Nicholas.<br> There hasn't been a recorded murder<br> in Sandford for 20 years.<br> But, sir, I'm certain.<br> And what's more, I know who did it.<br> Can I see the manager, please?<br> Mr. Skinner to the Manager's office.<br> Manager's office. Mr. Skinner.<br> Sergeant Angel.<br> And to what do I owe this pleasure?<br> Simon Skinner, I'm arresting you<br> on suspicion of the murder of Leslie Tiller.<br> Leslie Tiller's dead? How?<br> She tripped and fell on her own shears.<br> I'm also arresting you on suspicion of<br> the murder of Tim Messenger on May 1st,<br> of George Merchant on April 29th<br> and of Eve Draper<br> and Martin Blower on April 28th.<br> - Why on earth would I do that, Sergeant?<br> - I'm glad you asked.<br> My suspicions were first aroused<br> when you appeared<br> at the scene of the Blower-Draper death,<br> on the outskirts of Sandford,<br> despite the fact you live and work<br> in the center of the village.<br> I couldn't help but recall your comments<br> at the theater on the previous evening.<br> When you not only indicated<br> an awareness of the couple's affair<br> but also inferred<br> that Eve's connections at the council<br> might make her privy<br> to important information.<br> You even spoke of "bashing her head in."<br> Perhaps hoping you might discover<br> the route of the proposed Sandford Bypass.<br> You were already suspicious<br> that George Merchant was buying up<br> a large area of land<br> on the outskirts of Sandford,<br> after an article Tim Messenger<br> wrote in the Sandford Citizen.<br> You see, the land Merchant was buying<br> had little value in of itself but,<br> if it became accessible by road,<br> it would be a prime location for say,<br> a retail park.<br> Consumed with concern for your business<br> and potential disloyalty<br> from fickle customers,<br> you yourself expressed a wish to behead.<br> You killed the competition in cold blood.<br> Staging the murders as accidents.<br> You used a vehicle removal truck<br> to stage the Blower-Draper death<br> and incinerated an old man<br> in his own house.<br> Covering your tracks with the judicial<br> application of bacon and beans.<br> However, there was a loose end.<br> Tim Messenger.<br> Splattered before he could share with me<br> what he told Leslie Tiller<br> that very afternoon.<br> The true value of her land.<br> Upon discovering she was about<br> to sell up to the developers,<br> you brutally murdered her<br> with her own shears.<br> And made good your escape utilizing<br> your impressive skills as a fun runner.<br> Very entertaining. But I rather think<br> you've been watching too many films.<br> He hasn't.<br> Why would I kill Leslie?<br> You clearly aren't aware that we're related.<br> Oh, but I am, "Cousin Sissy."<br> I'm afraid my nickname of Sissy<br> is only a revelation to yourself.<br> My teenage years studying ballet<br> are well known.<br> - Yeah, Sissy Skinner.<br> - What a Gaylord.<br> Thank you, Andrews.<br> Now, despite my comments<br> about "beheading" customers,<br> I personally relish the competition<br> of another store.<br> Anything to energize my workforce.<br> And anyway, what makes you think<br> I could dislodge part of the church roof?<br> Or for that matter, stage a car crash?<br> It's a well known fact that<br> the church roof is in dire need of repair.<br> And isn't it true<br> that two of your own employees<br> operate the vehicle removal service<br> for the council?<br> Sergeant, this is the 21st Century.<br> Many people hold down several jobs.<br> I myself host a life drawing class<br> at the Village Hall.<br> Tina here is a table dancer at Flappers.<br> Nevertheless, you could have utilized<br> the vehicle removal truck for your own ends.<br> These accusations<br> are quite meaningless, Sergeant,<br> unless you can back them up<br> with hard evidence.<br> Well, you've got me there.<br> I'd need something conclusive.<br> Something that placed you<br> at the scene of the crime.<br> Perhaps a wound you sustained on<br> a piece of broken glass this very evening.<br> This very evening.<br> Sergeant, this is beginning<br> to get embarrassing.<br> How could I possibly be<br> in several places at once?<br> I'm sure the store's security footage<br> will absolve me.<br> Do feel free to spool through.<br> I can handle this, Danny.<br> You might as well go back<br> and just enjoy the rest of your birthday.<br> - Did you really get me that plant?<br> - Yes, I did.<br> But it's been impounded as evidence.<br> Well, I mean,<br> maybe Dad will still let me water it, eh?<br> Yeah.<br> Sergeant, I wanted you to know that<br> if I do indeed now<br> own the land belonging to...<br> belonging to Leslie, that I intend to turn it<br> into a memorial garden, in her honor.<br> Mr. Skinner, what you do with your land<br> is of no concern of mine,<br> so jog on.<br> Michael, will you escort the Sergeant<br> off the premises when he's quite finished?<br> Yarp.<br> I just can't believe Leslie's dead.<br> How did it happen?<br> She tripped and fell on her own shears.<br> Hey, that weren't me.<br> Hey, look.<br> Look, Mr. Treacher's<br> got his big coat on again.<br> - You want anything from the shop?<br> - Cornetto.<br> - No luck catching them killers, then?<br> - It's just the one killer, actually.<br> - No luck catching them killers, then?<br> - It's just the one killer, actually.<br> - No luck catching them killers, then?<br> - It's just the one killer, actually.<br> - No luck catching them killers, then?<br> - It's just the one killer, actually.<br> - What's the matter? You got brain-freeze?<br> - No, I got brainwave.<br> Get us back to the station, now!<br> - It's more than one person.<br> - Come again?<br> - It's more than one killer.<br> - It was Skinner a minute ago.<br> Yeah, well, maybe it still is.<br> You know, maybe he's... Maybe he's<br> not alone. Maybe there are others.<br> Nicholas, you're an exceptional officer.<br> But I've seen this before.<br> - Sir?<br> - Sergeant Popwell.<br> It was exactly the same thing.<br> You've come from a city<br> where there's danger round every corner,<br> and it's driven you round the bend.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Do yourself a favor. Sleep on it.<br> And if you still feel the same in the morning,<br> I give you my word, I'll get right on to it.<br> Hey. Hey, what's happening?<br> What's going on?<br> Nothing, nothing.<br> I'm just gonna go back to the hotel.<br> - I mean, do you want a lift?<br> - No, no, I could do with a walk.<br> Hey, big one, playtime's over.<br> Michael?<br> Michael? Are you there?<br> Michael? Is everything okay?<br> Yarp.<br> Sergeant Angel's been taken care of?<br> Yarp.<br> He's not gonna get back up again?<br> Narp!<br> Good. Proceed to the castle.<br> Frank, this shit just got real.<br> Skinner just sent someone to kill me,<br> and, now, now he's gone somewhere.<br> Up to the... To the castle, I think.<br> I'm gonna... I'm gonna go after him.<br> Okay? It's Nicholas, by the way.<br> Oh, my God.<br> What happened to your Peace Lily?<br> Danny. Danny, just stay here, okay?<br> And watch him, and call your dad.<br> - Tell him I was right.<br> - What are you gonna do?<br> - I'm gonna bust this thing wide open.<br> - Nicholas, wait.<br> - You might need this.<br> - Thanks, partner.<br> How could I possibly be<br> in several places at once?<br> How could I possibly be<br> in several places at once?<br> How could I possibly be<br> in several places at once?<br> I just can't believe Leslie's dead.<br> How did it happen?<br> You'll find that we run<br> a very tight ship here.<br> Who could do something like this?<br> Seems like Mr. Merchant tried<br> to have a little fry up and left the gas on.<br> Nasty way to go.<br> What happened, Danny?<br> No luck catching them killers, then?<br> No luck catching them killers, then?<br> No luck catching them...<br> Now, quick announcement before we begin.<br> Janet Barker has decided<br> to call her boys Roger and Martin.<br> And the christening will be<br> a week on Saturday and we're all invited.<br> - Tom.<br> - Thanks, Joyce.<br> Now, you'll all be delighted to hear<br> that the tenacious Sergeant Angel<br> has been taken care of.<br> Joyce will discover the Sergeant lying<br> on the wet floor of his bathroom,<br> having slipped<br> and tragically broken his neck.<br> So, with the dispatch of the Sergeant,<br> we will now be able to concentrate<br> on the eradication of our hoodie infestation.<br> Quite right.<br> After which, nothing will stand in our way.<br> Oh, I beg to differ, Mr. Weaver.<br> Well, well, well, I see we have visitors.<br> Sergeant Nicholas Angel.<br> Sandford Police Service.<br> My, he is tenacious, isn't he?<br> I'm arresting you under suspicion<br> of conspiracy to commit murder.<br> Oh, come, come, Sergeant.<br> You should be ashamed.<br> - Calling yourself a community that cares.<br> - Oh, but we do care, Nicholas.<br> It's all about the greater good.<br> The greater good.<br> How can this be for the greater good?<br> The greater good.<br> You see, as much as I enjoyed<br> your wild theories, Sergeant,<br> the truth is far less complex.<br> Blower's fate was simply the result<br> of his being an appalling actor.<br> Quite appalling.<br> You murdered him for that?<br> - Well, he murdered Bill Shakespeare.<br> - What?<br> The Dramatic Society<br> is an important feather in our cap.<br> Couldn't let<br> Blower jeopardize that.<br> Not when we had two semi-professionals<br> waiting in the wings.<br> Let's not forget that Greg<br> was an extra in Straw Dogs.<br> And Sheree played a cadaver<br> in Prime Suspect.<br> Yes, I know!<br> Martin was less concerned<br> with the reputation of the village<br> than he was with his sordid affair<br> with Eve Draper.<br> And so Eve deserved to die too?<br> Well, she did have a very annoying laugh.<br> Annoying.<br> - And, and George Merchant?<br> - He had an awful house.<br> Awful.<br> We begged him in vain<br> to make his residence<br> more in keeping<br> with the village's rustic esthetic.<br> And what about Tim Messenger?<br> What was his crime?<br> Tim Messenger's tenure as editor of<br> the Sandford Citizen has been unbearable.<br> Our once great paper had<br> become riddled with tabloid journalism.<br> Not to mention persistent errors.<br> - He listed her age as 55.<br> - When, actually, I'm 53.<br> Fifty-three.<br> What, what about Leslie Tiller?<br> One of your own?<br> Her horticultural expertise helped<br> put Sandford on the map.<br> Oh, she was ever so good.<br> Cousin Leslie was a terrible shame.<br> But it seemed she was set on moving away.<br> We couldn't have her sharing<br> her green fingers with anybody else.<br> Not least those heathens at Buford Abbey.<br> If we can't have her, no one can.<br> How can this be for the greater good?<br> - The greater good.<br> - Shut it!<br> These people died for no reason.<br> No reason whatsoever!<br> Oh, I wouldn't say that.<br> Hello, Nicholas.<br> I was like you once.<br> I believed in the immutable word of the law.<br> That is until the night Mrs. Butterman<br> was taken from me.<br> You see,<br> no one loved Sandford more than her.<br> She was head of the Women's Institute,<br> chair of the floral committee.<br> When they started<br> the Village of the Year contest,<br> she worked round the clock.<br> I've never seen such dedication.<br> On the eve of the adjudicator's arrival,<br> some travelers moved into Callahan Park.<br> Before you could say, "Gypsy scum,"<br> we were knee-deep in dog muck,<br> thieving kids and crusty jugglers.<br> Crusty jugglers.<br> We lost the title and Irene lost her mind.<br> She drove her Datsun Cherry<br> into Sandford Gorge.<br> From that moment on,<br> I swore that I would do her proud.<br> And whatever the cost,<br> we would make Sandford great again.<br> Sir, this doesn't make any sense.<br> The adjudicators arrive tomorrow.<br> We had to get everything ready.<br> Are you saying this is all about<br> winning the Best Village Award?<br> This is the best village, Nicholas.<br> You've seen the people.<br> - They're happy, contented.<br> - They're living in a dream world.<br> Sergeant Popwell<br> thought much the same as you.<br> I'm disappointed<br> you can't see the bigger picture.<br> Well, I'm happy to disappoint you, sir.<br> And I'm afraid<br> you're gonna have to come with me.<br> You are all gonna have to come with me.<br> No, Nicholas, I'm afraid it is you<br> who is going to have to come with us.<br> Danny, no.<br> Back off! Back off!<br> Or I swear to God,<br> you'll be explaining how Danny tripped over<br> and accidentally cut off his own head.<br> Come on, Nicholas.<br> You haven't got it in you.<br> I mean it!<br> Shit!<br> Gypsy scum. Travelers.<br> Thieving kids. Dog muck.<br> Crusty jugglers.<br> Crusty jugglers. Crusty jugglers.<br> Crusty jugglers.<br> There hasn't been a recorded murder<br> in Sandford for 20 years.<br> There's a reason we accommodate<br> a few of the younglings at the pub.<br> Spot of bother up at Ellroy Farm.<br> I'll make sure everyone gets<br> their just deserts.<br> If we don't come down hard<br> on these clowns...<br> We'll get round to it.<br> Danny!<br> Ta-da.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - Saving your skin.<br> - This is murder!<br> - It's not, it's ketchup.<br> I'm not talking about that,<br> I'm talking about the others.<br> - What others?<br> - The others the NWA have murdered.<br> - That's not true.<br> - It is!<br> Dad just said it was his special club, he...<br> I thought it was about<br> rapping people on the knuckles<br> - and sending them on their way.<br> - There are skeletons back there!<br> I don't know nothing about no skelingtons.<br> - What did you think was happening?<br> - Not this!<br> It's Frank.<br> He's appointed himself judge,<br> jury and executioner.<br> - He's not Judge Judy and executioner.<br> - He is!<br> - You've gotta help me take him down.<br> - I can't.<br> He's my dad. Take my car.<br> Go back to London.<br> There's nothing you can do.<br> I can come back.<br> I can come back,<br> and I can bring the blue fury<br> of the Metropolitan Police Service with me.<br> They'll make it disappear.<br> Who are they gonna believe?<br> My dad, or a loony London police officer.<br> But it won't be just me, will it?<br> We can do it together.<br> You and me. Partners.<br> Forget it, Nicholas. It's Sandford.<br> Is that everything? Sir?<br> Sir? Sir?<br> - Is there anything I can do for you?<br> - No.<br> This is something I have to do myself.<br> Another beautiful day in God's country.<br> Danny?<br> It's...<br> Mum!<br> What you gonna do?<br> Just walk in and arrest the whole village?<br> Not exactly.<br> Oh, Sergeant Angel?<br> Someone from London called for you.<br> I'll tell them you'll ring them back.<br> - Well, that's funny.<br> - What's that?<br> I didn't know we had a mounted division.<br> Nobody tells me nothing.<br> Wanna do something useful?<br> Annette, that Sergeant Angel's<br> back. Check out his horse.<br> Roger that!<br> - It's...<br> - Angel.<br> Morning.<br> That's what I'm talking about.<br> Still feel like you're missing out?<br> Fascist!<br> Hag!<br> Stop! Stop this, please!<br> Let us stop this mindless violence.<br> Nicholas, my son.<br> You may not be a man of God,<br> but surely you're a man of peace.<br> I may not be a man of God, Reverend,<br> but I know right, and I know wrong,<br> and I have the good grace<br> to know which is which.<br> Oh, fuck off, Grasshopper.<br> No!<br> Jesus Christ!<br> Nicholas! Nicholas!<br> I thought you was a goner.<br> Drop your weapons!<br> - Dr. Hatcher, no!<br> - Shut up, Danny.<br> I brought you into this world,<br> I think it's rather fitting<br> I should be the one to take you out of it.<br> You and your interfering little friend.<br> Now...<br> drop them.<br> - You're a doctor, deal with it.<br> - Yeah, motherfucker.<br> - Danny, let's roll.<br> - What you thinking?<br> Pub?<br> Roy!<br> Somebody call the police!<br> Freeze!<br> Officers, arrest that man.<br> - Danny, step away from the Sergeant.<br> - No, Dad.<br> Danny, you'll do as you're told.<br> I'm not taking orders from you anymore.<br> - Officers, arrest these men!<br> - Wait, wait!<br> You can arrest us if you like.<br> You can throw us in prison and go back<br> to being blind, submissive slaves.<br> Or you can be real police officers,<br> and help us bring an end<br> to this absurd story.<br> What the fuck is he on about?<br> Fuck are you on about?<br> Have you ever wondered<br> why the crime rate in Sandford is so low?<br> - And yet the accident rate, it's so high?<br> - No. Yeah. What?<br> You've been brainwashed, Tony.<br> Brainwashed into naivety by an old man<br> with a murderous obsession.<br> - This is ridiculous.<br> - No, it's not, Dad. It's very unridiculous.<br> And it's only now that I'm starting to realize<br> how unridiculous it all is.<br> Silence, Danny!<br> - Think of your mother.<br> - Mum is dead, Dad.<br> For the first time in my life,<br> you know, I'm glad.<br> If she could see what you've become,<br> I think she'd probably kill herself<br> all over again.<br> Sorry, I am completely lost.<br> Sandford is a lie, Doris.<br> For the last 20 years, the village<br> has been controlled by Frank and the NWA.<br> They've lulled everyone<br> into thinking this is a perfect village<br> and killed anyone<br> who's threatened to change that.<br> I reckon he's got something there.<br> He says,<br> "He reckons you got something there."<br> I know.<br> You're not seriously gonna<br> believe this man, are you?<br> Are you? He isn't even from round here.<br> Maybe it's time to give it up, sir.<br> You incompetent flatfoots!<br> Officer Walker, stay here with Saxon<br> and hold everything down.<br> Fair enough.<br> Officers, let's go.<br> - What about Dad?<br> - He'll come round again.<br> Want anything from the shop?<br> - What you thinking?<br> - Well...<br> We should strike now,<br> while we've got the element of surprise.<br> Longer we wait,<br> more time they've got to mobilize.<br> I say we go in through the front entrance,<br> take the place aisle by aisle.<br> They won't be expecting that.<br> Very good. What he said.<br> My, my. Here come the fuzz.<br> - Maybe they're not here.<br> - Wait here.<br> - Don't go in on your own.<br> - Don't worry, he knows what he's doing.<br> Okay. They're in.<br> You deal with the store.<br> I'll deal with the trolley boy.<br> No, listen. Wait, wait, wait, Michael,<br> wait, listen to me. Listen, listen.<br> Is this what you really, really want?<br> Yarp.<br> Suit yourself.<br> Go, go, go.<br> Oh, come on.<br> Andy!<br> It's all right, Andy. It's just Bolognese!<br> - How's Lurch?<br> - He's in the freezer.<br> - Did you say, "Cool off"?<br> - No, I didn't say anything, actually.<br> Shame.<br> There was a bit earlier on that you missed<br> when I distracted him<br> with the cuddly monkey.<br> And then I said, "Playtime's over,"<br> and I hit him with the Peace Lily.<br> You're off the fucking chain!<br> - What's the situation?<br> - Two blokes and a fuckload of cutlery.<br> What do you reckon?<br> Idea.<br> Good work, everyone.<br> - Nice one, Doris.<br> - Nothing like a bit of girl on girl.<br> Fruit attack!<br> Can you handle this, Sergeant Fisher?<br> We're gonna go after the big boss.<br> We're on it, Sergeant.<br> - Danny, let's rock.<br> - Angel!<br> Don't go being a twat now.<br> I wouldn't give you the satisfaction.<br> - We should get down there.<br> - How?<br> Skip.<br> - Head them off?<br> - Fuck, yeah.<br> - I'll drive.<br> - Shotgun! Punch that shit!<br> Bang! Bang!<br> Swan!<br> Swan!<br> Stay back! Or the ginger nut gets it!<br> You little fucker!<br> Get out of my village!<br> It's not your village anymore.<br> - You did good, kid.<br> - Ta.<br> - What's your name?<br> - Aaron A. Aaronson.<br> Sorry?<br> Angel!<br> It's over, Danny.<br> It's over.<br> This really hurts.<br> I'm going to need some ice-cream.<br> Yeah, well, don't worry.<br> There's plenty of ice-cream at the station.<br> Isn't that right, Danny?<br> Stay back!<br> - Pack it in, Frank, you silly bastard!<br> - Now, now.<br> We don't want any more bloodshed.<br> Frank, this whole thing started<br> because you lost somebody you loved.<br> Don't expect me to believe<br> you'd let it end the same way.<br> I'll tell you how this is gonna end!<br> I feel like I should say something smart.<br> You don't have to say anything at all.<br> Satisfactory conclusion<br> to the whole operation.<br> Now, my perfect Sunday would begin with...<br> What do you say, Nicholas?<br> We... We...<br> We have been trying to reach you for days.<br> - Yeah, well, I've been kind of busy.<br> - We need you back.<br> The figures have gone a little squiffy<br> in your absence, it has to be said.<br> Come back to London.<br> Sandford's hardly a fitting place<br> for such an exceptional officer.<br> Yeah, well, the thing is, sir.<br> I kind of like it here.<br> Besides, we have to do<br> a considerable amount of paperwork.<br> - Fuck's sake, Nick, this is gonna take ages.<br> - Yeah, it's gonna take all night.<br> Well, good job<br> we've got the manpower, Andy?<br> Well, official vocab guidelines state<br> that we say "staffing," not "manpower,"<br> 'cause "manpower's" a bit sexist.<br> You don't mind a bit<br> of manpower do you, Doris?<br> Oh, dirty bastard!<br> Andy!<br> You cheeky fucker!<br> You know what you are?<br> A bloody busybody!<br> No!<br> Oh, God, no!<br> Danny!<br> Danny!<br> Oh, God.<br> Hold on, Danny, just hold on.<br> Hold on, it's gonna be fine.<br> It's gonna be fine.<br> Just hang on, hang on!<br> Everything's gonna be fine.<br> Everything's gonna be fine.<br> Everything's gonna be fine.<br> Everything's gonna be just fine.<br> Hope these are okay.<br> Yeah. They're lovely.<br> - Any officers near the church?<br> - Go ahead, Doris.<br> Chief, we've had a report<br> of some hippy types<br> messing with the recycling bins<br> at the supermarket.<br> - Leave it with us.<br> - Righto.<br> Sergeant Butterman,<br> little hand says it's time to rock and roll.<br> Bring the noise.<br>
